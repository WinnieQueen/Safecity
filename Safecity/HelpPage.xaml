            The data shown is data collected from an entire county where the town entered resides in.
            If the requested year is very large, the user may not get the best results; many police stations only go back to a certain number of years, while others go back further, so there may be inconsistencies in the gathered information.
                    
            Data collected by 'age' is collected using an age range calculated from the entered user age, starting from 0-9; for example, if '13' is entered, the range for the data is 10-19.
            
            Specific Risks:
            These charts show the comparison between specific risks solely for the user's demographics. These charts do not include any data outside of the user's demographic.
                    
            Violent Crimes By [Demographic]:
            These charts show the danger for violent crimes for other demographics vs the user's demographics. Violent crimes include: aggravated assault, homicide, and rape.
                    
            Property Crimes By [Demographic]:
            These charts show the danger for property crimes for other demographics vs the user's demographics. Property crimes include: burglary, larceny, motor-vehicle theft, robbery, and arson.
                    
            If you are experiencing issues with the search for unknown reasons, these are common possibilities:
                    1. Your specific city could not be found inside of the database to get the county.
                    2. The county found does not have any supported police stations.
                    3. Either the city or state are spelled incorrectly. These are NOT case sensitive.
                    4. The county is very large and you are requesting all 3 demographics worth of data; calculating can take a very long time.
