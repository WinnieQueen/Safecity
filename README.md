# Safecity

This program is designed to help users understand the risks associated with traveling to an area.
It uses APIs, HTMLs, and a Zip Code Database to grab, parse, and present crime data to the user.

This is coded entirely using C# in Xamarin (Visual Studio 2019).

Currently, it does not support iOS.
